[\"end-section\"]\n[\"initializing\"] Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] I remember that probability often involves figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"deduction\"] So, I think I should start by understanding the total number of ways to draw three cards from the deck and then figure out how many of those ways result in exactly two hearts. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] First, let's recall that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 13 cards in each of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] So, there are 13 hearts in the deck. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] Now, when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, I should use combinations because the order in which we draw the cards doesn't matter. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"] So, the total number of ways to draw three cards from the deck is C(52, 3). [\"end-section\"]\n[\"example-testing\"] Let me compute that. 52 choose 3 is 52! / (3!(52 - 3)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 22100. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"uncertainty-estimation\"] Wait, is that right? [\"end-section\"]\n[\"example-testing\"] Let me check: 52 divided by 3 is about 17, but actually, 52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 is 132600, and 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 is 6, so 132600 / 6 is indeed 22100. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"deduction\"] Okay, so total possible outcomes are 22,100. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"] Now, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways to draw exactly two hearts and one non-heart. [\"end-section\"]\n[\"deduction\"] So, I need to compute the number of ways to choose two hearts from the 13 available, and then one non-heart from the remaining 39 cards (since 52 - 13 = 39). [\"end-section\"]\n[\"deduction\"] So, that would be C(13, 2) \u00d7 C(39, 1). [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"example-testing\"] Let me compute C(13, 2) first. [\"end-section\"]\n```"

Hmm, let me think about what perfect squares and perfect cubes are. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, numbers like 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on. Perfect cubes, on the other hand, are numbers that can be written as the cube of integers. Examples include 1, 8, 27, 64, and so forth. I remember that numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes are called perfect powers, and they have something to do with exponents. I think they have to do with something called least common multiples or something about exponents. I think it has to do with the number 0 and exponents. Wait, maybe it's about exponents and factors. Let me recall, a perfect square is any number that can be expressed as n\u00b2 where n is an integer. A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as n\u00b3, where n is also an integer. So, if a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a number that can be expressed as n\u00b2 and also as m\u00b3, where n and m are integers. I think these numbers are called perfect sixth powers. Is that right? Because I remember that 1 is a perfect square and a perfect cube, and it's 1\u00b2 and 1\u00b3. Then, 64 is a perfect square because 8\u00b2 is 64, and it's also a perfect cube because 4\u00b3 is 64. Wait, 64 is 2\u2076, right? Yeah, 2\u2076 is 64, and 64 is also 4\u00b2 and 8\u00b3. So, 64 is a perfect square, a perfect cube, and a perfect sixth power. So, I think that perfect sixth powers are numbers that can be expressed as n\u2076, where n is an integer. The reason why perfect squares and cubes have something to do with exponents is because when you're dealing with prime factorization, perfect squares have even exponents in their prime factorization. For example, 36 is 6\u00b2, which is (2\u00d73)\u00b2, and when you break it down into primes, 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2, the ex",

Let me check that.\n\nIf a number is a perfect square, it can be written as \\( n^2 \\), and if it's a perfect cube, it can be written as \\( m^3 \\). So, if a number is both, it must satisfy both equations. That means \\( n^2 = m^3 \\). Hmm, so \\( n^2 = m^3 \\). To find such numbers, we can express both sides with the same exponent. \n\nLet me think about exponents. If I can write both sides with the same exponent, maybe by expressing them as a power of some common base. So, if \\( n^2 = m^3 \\), then \\( n \\) must be a cube and \\( m \\) must be a square. Let me explain that again. \n\nSuppose \\( n = k^3 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then, \\( n^2 = (k^3)^2 = k^6 \\). Similarly, if \\( m = k^2 \\), then \\( m^3 = (k^2)^3 = k^6 \\). So, both sides equal \\( k^6 \\), which means \\( k^6 \\) is a number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. \n\nTherefore, the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes are exactly the sixth powers of integers. So, the smallest such number greater than 100 would be the smallest \\( k^6 \\) where \\( k",

Hmm, let me think about what that means. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] First, a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as some integer squared, right? Like 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. Similarly, a perfect cube is a number that can be written as an integer cubed, like 1, 8, 27, 64, etc. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"] So, the number we're looking for has to be both of these. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"uncertainty-estimation\"] Wait, so if a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, what does that make it? [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"] I remember something about least common multiples or something. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"] Maybe it's a sixth power? Because 6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which are the exponents in squares and cubes. [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"example-testing\"] Let me check that.

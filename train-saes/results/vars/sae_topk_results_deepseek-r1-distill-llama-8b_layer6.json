            "She's also had chest pain, which in the context of a possible aortic issue, could be due to dissection or aneurysm expansion",
            "But the optic disc changes are more concerning for something like pseudotumor cerebri, which is often idiopathic but can be related to increased intracranial pressure from various causes, including hypothyroidism, brain tumors, or even from prolonged sitting or certain medications",
            "Bilateral crackles at the lung bases point towards pulmonary issues, maybe interstitial or alveolar, but given her history and other findings, it's probably related to her heart",
            "The muffled heart sounds and S4 might indicate right heart strain, which can happen with pulmonary hypertension, another common complication in COPD",
            "Another angle is that he might have a cocaine-induced aortic dissection or another condition, but the absence of specific signs like back pain or hemodynamic instability makes that less likely",
            "Smoking can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the presence of a murmur and LVH points more towards a cardiovascular issue",
            "The fact that his chest pain is radiating down his left arm makes me think of a left-sided condition, maybe a myocardial infarction, but the ECG doesn't show ST-segment elevation, which is more typical of an acute MI",
            "The chest pain radiating to the left arm makes me think of a left-sided condition, maybe a myocardial infarction, but the ECG doesn't show ST-segment elevation, which is more typical of an acute MI",
            "But since her abdomen is scaphoid, maybe she has some ascites, which can be a result of infections like Cryptosporidium",
            "The physical exam didn't show any other signs, like abdominal tenderness or distension, which might suggest something like ascites or a more inflamed bowel",
            "I should also consider other possibilities, like infective endocarditis, but her murmur has been there since early adulthood, and there's no mention of fever or other signs of infection"

INCLUDED are statements that describe the transfer of energy, the action of forces, or the sequence of events that produce an outcome (e.g., \"the tension must provide the necessary force to overcome the weight and the normal force\"). NOT INCLUDED are mere statements of fact, definitions, calculations, or procedural steps without explicit causal explanation. These sentences typically appear in the middle of reasoning traces, after the problem is set up and before or during the application of equations or calculations, serving to bridge conceptual understanding and quantitative analysis.",

            "When the ball is submerged in water, the buoyant force acts upward, reducing the net force that the wire has to support",
            "So, the elevator is moving upward with some acceleration, which means the tension must be greater than the weight because it needs to not only counteract the weight but also provide the necessary force to accelerate it upward",

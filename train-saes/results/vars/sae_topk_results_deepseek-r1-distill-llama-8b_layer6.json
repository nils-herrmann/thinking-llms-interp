Sentences in this category explicitly signal the culmination of reasoning\u2014often using phrases like \"putting it all together,\" \"to sum up,\" or \"in conclusion\"\u2014and articulate the selected answer, main point, or most compelling interpretation. INCLUDED are statements that summarize and weigh prior reasoning to directly state the answer or main claim; NOT INCLUDED are intermediate summaries, restatements of facts, or steps that merely advance the reasoning without final integration.

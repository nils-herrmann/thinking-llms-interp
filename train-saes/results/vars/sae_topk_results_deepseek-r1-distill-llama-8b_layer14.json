          "description": "This function involves explicitly writing out relevant formulas, substituting known values, and performing step-by-step calculations to arrive at a numerical or algebraic result. Included are sentences that (a) state or rearrange formulas, (b) substitute problem-specific values, and (c) carry out arithmetic or algebraic manipulations, often in a sequential, annotated manner. NOT included are sentences that merely discuss concepts, set up the problem context, interpret results, or make qualitative judgments. These sentences typically appear in the middle of the reasoning process, after the problem has been understood and before the final answer or interpretation is given.",

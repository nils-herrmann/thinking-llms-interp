These sentences articulate how altering one factor (such as price, demand, supply, or cost) would logically affect other variables, often using economic or scientific principles. Included are statements that explicitly link a change in one variable to a predicted outcome in another, typically using \"if...then...\" or similar constructions; NOT included are mere definitions, factual recalls, or explanations without a conditional or causal projection.
